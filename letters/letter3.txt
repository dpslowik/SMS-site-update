Dear Stan: Over the last 20-years, your instruction has proved invaluable to our organization.  Training our District managers and Human Resource personnel in Event Analysis and Objective Pre-employment Interviewing has reduced our exposure to wrongful discharge lawsuits, reduce cash shortages, helped eleminate "problem people" before they were hired, and Detect deception during our internal investigation.  I am still amaze4d at how effective your interviewing techniques can be at discovering the "hidden facts." Everytime you finish a class for us, participants relay post-training success stories of how they used your techniques to solve problems, detect deception, and save time and money.  Personally, I admire your superb teaching skills, excellent use of real-world examples, and real-life experiences that you use while you teach.  I will be contacting you soon to setup our next refresher session.  Best wishes, J. Mark Eagleton Director of Training and Personnel, The Bailey Company d.b.a. Arby's Roast Beef Restaurants
