Dear Mr. Slowik: I attended your Objective Pre-Employment Interview training a couple years ago and was very impressed with the program and your professionalism.  I appreciate your prompt response to an interview situation our department recently encountered.  I want to thank you for the Objective Pre-Employment Interview training.  I was so impressed with the program, I convinced my superiors to adopt the process.  The Marshall Police Department uses your pre-employment model as the second phase of our hiring process.  We have used this process for approximately two years with great success.  In the current economic environment, hiring can be taxing for a small department with less than 15 officers.  The pre-employment interview process has helped us narrow the field of candidated and to find candidates with the best fit for our department.  The process has also assisted our background investigators by narrrowing the focus of their investigation.  I look forward to sending our staff to your future trainings and I wish you continued success.  Sincerely, Josh Lankerd, Sergeant
