Dear Mr Stanley Slowik: I would like to thank you for your seminar, Objective Pre-Employment Interviewing - Dealing Effectively with Applicant Misrepresentation, which you conducted at one of our Department's Regional Commands back in February of 1999.  Since your seminar, our Background investigators have used your techniques and have truly learned to interview applicants instead of interrogating them.  The Background Investigators have even started [to] use the phrase "Slowik the applicants."  I know that through your seminar, the Investigators have saved the Department both time and money by having the applicants admit to different facts not listed in their Personal History Statements.  By these admissions, the Investigators are able to either dig deeper or have the applicant withdraw from the process all together.  I am confident that through your seminar, the investifations and applicants being selected are best qualified for the position of Police Officers for the City of El Paso.  I hope that funding will be allowed for another seminar in the year 2000.  The investigators, who attended your seminar, speak very highly of the information and techniques you taught them.  In the future, all of teh background investigators will return to the seminar or attend for the first time.  If there is anything that I can do to assist you in the future, please feel free to contact me.  Sincerely, Greg D. Brickey, Captain, Support Services, El Paso Police Department
