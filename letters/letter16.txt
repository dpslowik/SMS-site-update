Dear Mr. Slowik: I attended the Objective Pre-employment Interviewing Seminar in May 2000.  I enjoyed the training and have used the provided regerence materials often.  This training sparked an interest in background investigatoins.  Subsequently, I was hired by a private contractor to conduct backgrounds on US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) applicants on a part-time basis and I am now approaching 1,000 interviews!  Thank you for stirring an interest in a skill I was unaware I possessed.  I retired recently, after serving over twenty-five years with the Montana Highway Patrol, and established a consulting business, Ten 8 Services, LLC.  My intent is to conduct objective pre-employment interviews and background investigations for government agencies, schools and private businesses.  Of course, I will continue to conduct the DHS related investigations I throughly enjoy.  I have registered to attend the upcoming seminar in Helena, MT as a skills regresher and an opportunity to receive your updated reference materials.  Thanks again for an excellent presentation all those years ago.  Sincerely, Capt. Clancy King
