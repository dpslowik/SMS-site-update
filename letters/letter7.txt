Dear Stanley: I want to report to you regarding the evaluations completed by the students who attended your seminar, Objective Pre-employment Interviewing, conducted in Tallahassee in May of 1999.  Both the Course and Instructor evaluations were Excellent.  The primary categories of the evaluations, which recieved excellent marks were: 1. The class objectives were fully explained and reviwed during the class. 2. The class design was well organized and time was well spent. 3. The class materials were up-to-date and were of excellent quality. 4. The class was very useful, practical and valuable for progessional development. 5. Your instructional methods were excellent toward achieving the course objectives. 6. The instructoinal level was appropriate for teh students. 7. Your knowledge of the subject matter reflects your professional experience in the subject matter.  Based on the feedback from yhour past students and FDLE's goal to offer only quality training courses to our members, as well as to the Florida Criminal Justice Community, at large.  We are looking forward to having you return next year.  If there is anything I can do to assist you in the future, please do not hesitate to contact me.
