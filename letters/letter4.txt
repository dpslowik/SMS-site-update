Dear Stan: On behalf of the Arvada Police Department, I wanted to thank you for your seminar "Objective Pre-employment Interviewing," which you instructed at our deparment.  The evaluations of those in attendance were very positive, the common notation being the class was informatice and well presented.  The Commander in our Administrative Bureau has made your class a requirement for all officers/detiectives involved in our recruitment process.  We appreciate your taking the time to conduct this training at our department and look forward to your returning in the spring.  Please let me know if we may assist you in anyway.
