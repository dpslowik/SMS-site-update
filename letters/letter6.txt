Dear Stan: I want [to] take this opportunity to thank you for conducting your fourth seminar, "Objective Pre-Employment Interviewing," at the Hollywood Police Department this past November.  Once again, it was an absolute success.  During the past four years you've taught over 100 background investigators from the South Florida area.  As Vice-President of the South Florida Backround Investigator's Associatoin, I can tell you that the feedback from your seminars continues to be excellent.  The investigators who've attended the seminar constantly remind of the benefits.  The most important benefit they mention is the 120-page instructional guide that is included in the seminar.  I still refer to that guide on a regular basis, four years after first taking the seminar.  Thank you for continuing to share your vast amount of knowledge with the background investigators in the South Florida area.  Sincerely, Detictive Tom Demmery, Personnel Unit
