Dear Mr. Slowik, Thank you for your presentation, "Objective pre-employment Interviewing." The seminar was very interesting and beneficial to the Fort Myers Police Department. The techniques learned will enhance the skills used by other officers and myself when interviewing applicants.  The Fort Myers Police Department prides itself on carefully selecting applicants for positions as law enforcement officers to ensure we maintain a professional agency.  Therefore, we do not consider sending officers to seminars that will not help us achieve our goals.  Your seminar is one that we would use because it is certain to help us acheive our goal of obtaining exceptional candidates.  Sincerely, Major Kevin A. Anderson Operations Bureau Commander
