Dear Mr. Stanley Slowik: Thank you so much for taking the time our of your busy schedule to come speak to us.  Ever since we planned this event last semester, everyone has been so excited to hear you speak and needless to say, you did not let us down.  Criminal Interrogation is an interesting topic on its own, but the amount of information and insight you provided captivated the audience.  It was remarkable to see how much knowledge you had and how well you were able to preesnt it to us.  Our events are not mandatory, and based on how many people showed up and stayed throughout the talk, illustrated just how intriguing you were.  Your deep understanding of this topic was clear and the amusing personal stories you told aided in comprehending this material.  This was a phenomenal experience for everyone who participated and we would gladly recommend you to others in need of a speaker.  Again, we thank you for keeping the audience captivated and providing everyone with valuable information.  Sincerly, PSI CHI National Honors Society, Boulder Chapter
