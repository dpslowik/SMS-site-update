Dear Mr. Slowik: I attended your seminar "Objective Pre-Employment Interviewing" in Plano, Texas in March of 2000.  Prior to this time, our agency had experienced much difficulty in dealing with applicant misrepresentation.  After a lengthy screening process, approximately 60% of our applicants were either failing the polygraph examination or making significant admissions to our polygraph operator which they had failed to disclose prior to the polygraph examination.  Your interviewing techniques were utilized on our next eligibilty list which consited of 16 applicants.  The interviewing techniques I learned led to the immediate disqualification of 8 applicants due to their significant admissions during the interview.  Amazingly, we were able to hire 7 officers from that list, which was a much higher percentage than our normal 10-15% hiring rate.  Of the 8 applicants that proceeded to the polygraph examination, only one made significant admissions to the polygraph operator which lead to his disqualification.  The other 7 passed the polygraph examinatoin with no difficulty.  This type of interview has tremendously increased the speed in which we process appplicants throguh our screening process.  We are now able to disqualify the undesirable applicants quickly so that we can concentrate on teh best applicants on our list.  I have told several officers within our Department, including the Chief, that "Objective Pre-Employment Interviewing" is the most useful training that I have attended in years.  I am sending another officer to this training this year.  This in itself is a testimonial to the quality of training that you provided.  I am very appreciative of the training you provided and look forward to its continued success within our Department.  Sincerely, Mike Medders, Asst. Chief of Police, Palestine, TX P.D.
