Dear Stan/Rhea: We appreciate your follow-up to the course provided in March 2002.  I have already heard from one of the law enforcement attendees that he has successfully used the training during investigative interviewing.  Please feel free to use the following testimonial on your website: After attending the "Objective Pre-Employment Interviewing" course a couple of years ago, we reduced the candidate rejection rate from around 40% to approximately 2%.  The course saved us so much time and money we were compelled to bring the training to our Site.  Stan, I hope you found a safe place for that Hanford Patrol coffee mug as you have a limited edition.  I look forward to meeting you again.  Sincerely, H.L. (Skip) Roberts, Deputy Chief, Hanford Patrol
