Dear Stanley: I wanted to thank you so much for your seminar, "Objective pre-employment Interviewing," which you conducted at our training facility in January.  I can't tell you how positive our results have been by utilizing the techniques we learned!  We are saving so much of the investigators' time and our Department's money by getting admissions early in the interview!  As busy as we are right now, I know all the investigators in my section really appriciate the extra time they are saving.  More importantly, we are getting information from applicants which will enable us to select only the most qualified candidates for our Police Department.  I look forward to haveing you return next year.  The feedback from the investigators who attended this past seminar was so positive that I will be sure to send as many of my background investigators as I can in the future.  If there is anything I can do to assist you in the future, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,
Kathleen O'Connor, Sergeant,
Background Investigation Section
