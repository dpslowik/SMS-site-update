Stan Slowik: On behalf of the Jefferson County Probation Department, I wanted to thank you very much for the training you conducted on Tuesday, July 12, 2011.  We greatly appreciated it and it was very helpful for our line of work!  I received great feedback - especially from the investigations unit.  Thank you again! I am on the lookout as well for a 1st Judicial District Probation Department coffee mug, I know we have them!  Thanks again, Heather Schwede, Probation Officer, 1st Judicial District, Jefferson County Probation Dept.
