Dear Stan: It was a pleaure to hear from you and of your recent involvement with the State Police in New Jersey.  I'm sure they will have as much success with your superb interviewing techniques, as our agency has had for many years.  From my first exposure to your seminar in 1984, through the development of our Pre-Employment Interview and acceptability guidelines and the implementation of these procedures, I have found your services to be of the highest quality.  It is hard to believe that more than ten years later, we are still using the initial programs you helped us develop and are still finding them highly successful and valid in screening law enforcement applicants.  Stan, you bring a level of insight, creaticity, and experience to the critical task of pre-employment screening that is unmatched.  You are a suberb innovator, trainer, and consultant who adds value to any organization.  I am happy to see that you continue to have success, particulary in the law enforcement areana, where screening applicants is of utmost importance. I look forward to working with you in the future.  Sincerely, J.M. Vanyur, Ph.D, Warden
